# Version 0

## Intro
In this section, I focused on designing the fitness application before diving straight into any form of development.
I leveraged tools such as Figma and draw.io to flesh out my Frontend UI and Backend relationships 

I practiced key skills such as: 
- Software Architecure Design (MVVM)
- UML Diagraming
- Model Design
- View Design
- ViewModel Design 

# Version 1
## Intro
In this section, I focused on the actual Backend implementation and testing of the MVVM architecture, allowing me to create complex and strong data structures, using best practice methods and skills.

Best practice methods and skills such as:
- Separation of Responsibility
- Principle of Least Privilege
- MVVM
- Unit Testing
- Inheritcane
- Object-Oriented Programming
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- Factory Design
- Singleton Design
- Test Driven Development
- Software Engineering
- Git
- Linux

Below is a demo showing off the progress at Version 1

| ![Test Alt Text](Trophy/Assets/Videos/ExerciseModalDemo.v1.gif) | This demo shows off our main ContentView (i.e. Homepage), an Exercise Summary Modal, and how Exercises with different attributes will be displayed according to the attributes they possess (e.g. Distance)|

# Version 2
## Intro
In this section, I focused on two topics. 
Firstly, allowing the user the ability to dynamically add Exercises in a UI friendly way. This key feature being implemented allowed absolute flexibility in the Exercise the user would want to create.
Secondly, practicing good UI design through the use of the Coolors.co website for developing proper Color Sets to use within my application.  

Skills Practiced in this Section Include:
- State Management
- Database Management
- Dynamic Content
- Component Design
- Color Sets
- User Input
- Event Handling
- Framework Development

This is where the power of the application truly starts to shine|

# Version 3
## Intro
This section is still in development. The current next steps are:
- Add the AWS SDK to my application
- Implement a connection with AWS RDS database for secure, reliable, and fast DB reads/writes
