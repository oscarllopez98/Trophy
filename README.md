# **Trophy**

## **What is Trophy?**

Trophy is an app that allows user to flexibly customize their unique exercises for the best insight possible to their fitness goals. This app reverses the idea other fitness tracking applications follow â€” requiring the user to follow data input guiderails, to instead the user providing any form of exercise data to the app.

Example Use Cases:
* Let's say you are a runner preparing for a competitive 5k. Other fitness tracking apps might track data like distance and time. However, you're curious to also track how much effort you put into each run, so that you can better understand how much effort it takes to run a certain time/distance. Trophy allows the standard tracking of distance and time, in addition to allowing you to choose an Intensity attribute, measured as either low, medium, or high. This combination gives you the ability to better understand how your runs truly vary for one another, ultimately giving you deeper insight to your fitness goals.
  
* Take an example where you are learning to climb at your local bouldering gym, and you would like to check your progress for a certain climb/beta. Trophy allows you to create your named exercise and choose to track attributes such as Time and Level (measured 0-10). This combination of exercise attributes allows you to better understand the progress of your specific climb over time.

## **Version 0** - _Backend Model + UI Design_

### Intro
In this section, I focused on designing the fitness application before diving straight into any form of development.
I leveraged tools such as Figma and draw.io to flesh out my Frontend UI and Backend relationships 

I implemented key skills such as: 
- Software Architecure Design (MVVM)
- UML Diagraming
- Model Design
- View Design
- ViewModel Design 

## **Version 1** - _MVVM Implementation + Unit Testing_
### Intro
In this section, I focused on the actual Backend implementation and testing of the MVVM architecture, allowing me to create complex and strong data structures, using Software Engineering best practices and skills.

Best practices and skills such as:
- Separation of Responsibility
- Principle of Least Privilege
- MVVM
- Unit Testing
- Inheritance
- Object-Oriented Programming
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- Factory Design
- Singleton Design
- Test Driven Development
- Software Engineering
- Git
- Linux

Below is a demo showing off the progress at Version 1

| Demo | Demo Content |
| --- | --- |
| ![Test Alt Text](Trophy/Assets/Videos/ExerciseModalDemo.v1.gif) | This demo shows off our main ContentView (i.e. Homepage), an Exercise Summary Modal, and how Exercises with different attributes will be displayed according to the attributes they possess (e.g. Distance)|

## **Version 2** - _Dynamic Content + Improved UI_
### Intro
In this section, I focused on two topics. 
Firstly, allowing the user the ability to dynamically add Exercises in a UI friendly way. This key feature being implemented allowed absolute flexibility in the Exercise the user would want to create.
Secondly, practicing good UI design through the use of the Coolors.co website for developing proper Color Sets to use within my application.  

Skills Implemented in this Section Include:
- State Management
- Database Management
- Dynamic Content
- Component Design
- Color Sets
- User Input
- Event Handling
- Framework Development

This is where the power of the application truly starts to shine|

# **Version 3** - _AWS RDS_
## Intro
This section is still in development. The current next steps are:
- Add the AWS SDK to my application
- Implement a connection with AWS RDS database for secure, reliable, and fast DB reads/writes
